          Welcome to ProtectHire! These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your
          use of the ProtectHire platform, including our website and mobile
          applications (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;), provided by ProtectHire
          (&quot;ProtectHire,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these

        <h2>1. Service Description & Role of ProtectHire</h2>
        <p>
          ProtectHire is a technology platform that connects individuals and businesses
          (&quot;Clients&quot;) seeking security services with independent security
          professionals, including guards and bouncers (&quot;Guards&quot;). We
          provide tools for Guards to create profiles, Clients to search for
          Guards, and facilitate communication and booking arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ProtectHire acts as a marketplace and is not an employer of Guards.
          </strong>
          Guards are independent contractors who are solely responsible for their
          professional conduct. We do not guarantee the quality, safety, or
          legality of the services provided by Guards or the requests made by
          Clients.
        </p>
