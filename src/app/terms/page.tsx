          Welcome to ProtectHire! These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your
          use of the ProtectHire platform, including our website and mobile
          applications (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;), provided by ProtectHire
          (&quot;ProtectHire,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;).
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
          Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not
          access the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>
          ProtectHire is a platform that connects individuals and businesses
          (&quot;Clients&quot;) seeking security services with independent security
          professionals, including guards and bouncers (&quot;Guards&quot;). We
          provide tools for Guards to create profiles, Clients to search for
          Guards, and facilitate communication and booking arrangements.
          ProtectHire is a neutral venue and does not employ Guards directly, nor
          does it guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of the services
          provided by Guards or the requests made by Clients.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>
          To use certain features of the Service, you must register for an
          account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete
          information during the registration process and to update such
          information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are
          responsible for safeguarding your password and for any activities or
          actions under your account.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any
          way that interrupts, damages, or impairs the service. You agree to

          or discrimination will not be tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guards are responsible for ensuring they have the necessary licenses,
          certifications, and insurance required by law to provide security
          services in their jurisdiction. Clients are responsible for verifying
          Guard credentials to their satisfaction.
